# BearBot (Not An Actual :bear:)

> Yo! This is my first ***formal*** approach to a bot. Essentially this bot :robot: is going read through a **twitter user's tweets** and create a sentiment analysis report (If your tweet was 'Positive', 'Negative' Or 'Neutral').

**NOTE:** In the future I'll pour more love to this

## Gaze Upon The Future

> You might say "Hey, but you're getting started!" and proly you're right, but I want to use this as a check list of features I want to add in the future.

    Future Features :rocket:
    âœ… API Boilerplate
    * [ ] unchecked # [checkbox:unchecked]
    * [x] checked   # [checkbox:checked]
    * [X] checked   # [checkbox:checked]
    [ ] Add Some Extra Params to the whole twitter search to spice things up.
    [ ] Approval/Disapproval Report (And Store The Reports)
    [ ] Trigger Any Sentiment Analysis From Anywhere! :round_pushpin:
    [ ] Display THe Reports In a Nice looking page

### Tools And Stuff (Or Just Do ```pipenv install```)

> Here's the whole list of the tools I'm using to make this happen:

    - Python 3.X
    - Conda
    - Pipenv
    - Django
    - Tweepy
    - python-dotenv
    - textblob

### Reasons why I did this

I really want this bot to go from simple all the way complicated for learning purposes. Plus! I love Python :snake:

#### Contribute

Just make a PR and we'll talk about it :beer:
