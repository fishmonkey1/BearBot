> Yo! This is my first ***formal*** approach to a bot. Essentially this bot :robot: is going read through a **twitter user's tweets** and create a sentiment analysis report (If your tweet was 'Positive', 'Negative' Or 'Neutral').

**NOTE:** In the future I'll pour more love to this

## Gaze Upon The Future

> You might say "Hey, but you're getting started!" and proly you're right, but I want to use this as a check list of features I want to add in the future.

    | Features :rocket:         |        Done        |
    |---------------------------|--------------------|
    | API Boilerplate           | :white_check_mark: |
    | Search Any User           |  |
    | Approval Report           |  |
    | Trigger From Anywhere     |  |
    | Display Reports           |  |

### Tools And Stuff (Or Just Do ```pipenv install```)

> Here's the whole list of the tools I'm using to make this happen:

    - Python 3.X
    - Conda
    - Pipenv
    - Django
    - Tweepy
    - python-dotenv
    - textblob

### Reasons why I did this

I really want this bot to go from simple all the way complicated for learning purposes. Plus! I love Python :snake:

#### Contribute
